# A five-minute tour of the image, on a throwaway machine:
#
#     ./tools/demo.sh          # boot a fresh `demo` machine and walk through it
#     ./tools/demo.sh reset    # delete it again: the machine, its /var and its key
#
# Four stops, each a few commands run over ssh and shown as they run:
#
#   1. the immutable root: EROFS on dm-verity, read-only, the root hash on the kernel
#      command line; the only writable state is /var
#   2. its identity: os-release with the commit it was built from, the machine ID and
#      hostname a VM gives it, and flfsfetch
#   3. a system extension attached to the running machine: the base has no podman, so
#      podman.raw is copied to /var/lib/extensions and merged with systemd-sysext
#   4. a container: a one-layer image made from the guest's own bash, run by podman and
#      crun, offline
#
# It needs what tools/vm.sh needs — qemu, ssh, and KVM to be quick — and an image with its
# extensions: this checkout's build (./tools/build-image.sh) if there is one, else CI's
# (./tools/fetch-image.sh). Nothing is added to the image; the demo is a machine of
# tools/vm.sh named `demo`, so every run starts from a fresh /var and leaves the image as
# it was. Each run resets first; `reset` alone just cleans up. The machine stays up
# afterwards for a look around (./tools/vm.sh ssh demo).
