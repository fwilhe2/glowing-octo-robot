# Run ci.yml on a branch whose head was pushed with GITHUB_TOKEN, and report the result on
# its pull request as a check run:
#
#     ./tools/dispatch-ci.sh <branch> <pr-url>
#
# Prints the run's conclusion and exits 0 only when it is `success`.
#
# GitHub starts no workflow run for a push made with GITHUB_TOKEN, so this asks for one:
# workflow_dispatch is the event the token is allowed to trigger. The run belongs to the
# branch rather than to the pull request, which is why the result has to be copied onto
# the pull request by hand, as the "Package update CI" check. And workflow_run is not
# emitted for a workflow dispatched with this token, so nothing can be told when the run
# ends — the caller stays alive until it does, which keeps the check from being left
# pending forever.
#
# Shared by update-packages.yml (a freshly opened pull request) and auto-merge.yml (one
# rebased onto main), which is the reason it is a script: both have to find the run
# they dispatched and not an older one, and only the second has an older one to find.
