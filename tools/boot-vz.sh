# Boot the image with Apple's Virtualization.framework (macOS on Apple silicon), console
# in this terminal, through vfkit — the command-line front end podman machine uses.
#
#     brew install vfkit
#     ARCH=arm64 ./tools/fetch-image.sh     # or build it; see README
#     ./tools/boot-vz.sh
#     ./tools/ssh.sh                        # from another terminal, over vsock
#
# Overrides, as for tools/boot-qemu.sh:
#   OUT, KERNEL, ROOTFS, INIT, MEM, CPUS, SSH, SSH_DIR, VAR_DISK, VAR_SIZE
#   VFKIT    the binary                         (default: vfkit on PATH)
#   SHARE    a host directory to share; in the guest: mount -t virtiofs share /mnt
#
# Untested by CI, which has no Mac: test/vmm.sh boots the image with the same devices on
# qemu (QEMU_PROFILE=vz) — an hvc0 console with no UART, virtiofs and ssh over vsock — and
# packages/kernel/build.sh's guest.config is what makes them work. The vfkit flags below
# are the part that has not been run, and are each marked where that matters.
#
# What it boots is the image every other script boots, unchanged: rootfs.erofs, the
# kernel arguments from rootfs.cmdline that carry its dm-verity root hash, and arm64's
# kernel, which is an uncompressed Image — what Virtualization.framework's Linux boot
# loader takes — staged under the name bzImage like amd64's. Intel Macs are not
# supported: the amd64 kernel is a bzImage, and nothing here has been tried with it.
#
# The network is Virtualization.framework's NAT, which hands out addresses over DHCP, so
# the image's own DHCP-on-everything networkd configuration is all the guest needs. ssh
# goes over vsock rather than through it, as with tools/boot-firecracker.sh: systemd's ssh
# generator puts sshd on vsock port 22 whenever the guest has a vsock device, and vfkit
# forwards a Unix socket on the host to that port.
#
# This script and the parts of test/qemu-lib.sh it uses run on macOS's bash 3.2 and BSD
# userland. Leave the guest with `poweroff`.
