# Merge the pull requests update-packages.yml opened, one at a time, each only after CI
# has passed on exactly the commit that lands on main:
#
#     ./tools/auto-merge.sh        # what .github/workflows/auto-merge.yml runs
#     ./tools/auto-merge.sh -n     # say what would happen, touch nothing (works locally)
#
# "Green" on its own is not enough, and that is most of this script. A bump's CI ran
# against main as it was when the pull request was opened, and the updater opens several
# at once — so after the first is merged, every other one was tested against a main that
# no longer exists. Each one is therefore rebased onto the current main and built again
# before it is merged, unless main has not moved since its last green run. The merge is a
# fast-forward push of that tested commit, not a merge button: a rebase or squash merge
# writes a new commit, and a merge commit a new tree, neither of which CI has seen. A push
# that is not a fast-forward is refused, which is what makes a human pushing to main
# mid-run safe — that pull request simply waits for the next run.
#
# A pull request is left alone, for a human, when:
#   - it is not from github-actions on an update/ branch — this merges bumps, not changes
#   - it carries the `hold` label — the way to say "not this one" without closing it
#   - it is younger than MIN_AGE_HOURS (default 24) — a business day to add that label
#   - any check on it failed — a red build needs work in build.sh, not a retry
#   - a check is still running and started recently — someone else's CI is in flight
#   - the rebase conflicts, or the rebuilt CI fails
#
# Scheduled runs only act at night in Europe: no pull request is started outside
# 22:00–03:00 UTC (00:00–05:00 CEST, 23:00–04:00 CET). GitHub's cron can start a run an
# hour or more late, so the schedule alone does not guarantee that — this check does, and
# it is made before each pull request rather than once, because one rebuild can take an
# hour. The cutoff leaves room for the last one and the CI on main after it to finish
# before the working day. A run started by hand (workflow_dispatch, or locally) is
# somebody choosing to act now, and is not held to the window.
#
# Pushes made with GITHUB_TOKEN start no workflow, which applies to main as much as to a
# branch: once anything was merged, ci.yml is dispatched on main, so publish-oci and the
# caches on main follow what landed.
