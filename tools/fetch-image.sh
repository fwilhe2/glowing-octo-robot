# Download a bootable combination of the latest rootfs image + kernel into
# output/boot-image/, with the system extensions built in the same run beside them.
#
# Both come out of the same CI run, because they have to match: the kernel is a package
# in this repo (kernel/), and its container.config fragment is what makes the image able
# to run containers at all. Pulling a kernel from anywhere else gives you a guest that
# boots and then quietly has no `memory` cgroup controller, no overlayfs and no veth.
#
# By default it grabs the latest successful CI run on main that built an image (skipping
# runs in progress, docs-only runs and [skip ci] commits), for the host's own architecture.
# Override any of:
#   ARCH         amd64 or arm64 (default the host's own architecture)
#   ROOTFS_RUN   pin a specific glowing-octo-robot run id
#   OUT          output directory (default output/boot-image, or output/boot-image-$ARCH
#                when ARCH is overridden away from the host's own)
#
# Nothing reaches $OUT unverified. The rootfs job of every CI run writes a manifest,
# bundle-<arch>/bundle.txt, naming the run, the commit and the arch, and the SHA-256 of
# every file in the three artifacts a boot needs (format below). This downloads that first,
# then the artifacts, and requires the two to agree exactly: same run, same commit as
# GitHub reports for it, every file listed present and matching, nothing unlisted. Only
# then is the bzImage taken out of the kernel's tar (after its member names are checked),
# the whole bundle assembled in a new directory beside $OUT, and the two swapped, so a
# failed or refused fetch leaves the previous bundle as it was. A run from before the
# manifest existed is refused; pin a newer one.
#
# bundle.txt, one record per line, `#` comments (written in ci.yml's rootfs job):
#   run <id>
#   commit <sha>
#   arch <amd64|arm64>
#   sha256 <hex> <artifact-name>/<path inside the artifact>     one per file
#
# The manifest proves the files are the ones that run produced and belong together. It is
# not a signature: it is fetched over the same authenticated gh connection as the files.
#
# Examples:
#   ./tools/fetch-image.sh
#   ARCH=arm64 ./tools/fetch-image.sh
#   ROOTFS_RUN=29703135782 ./tools/fetch-image.sh
