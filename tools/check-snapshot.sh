# Is the Debian snapshot both images are pinned to still current?
#
#     ./tools/check-snapshot.sh           # human readable
#     ./tools/check-snapshot.sh --json    # the shape update-packages.yml consumes
#
# The toolchain answer to tools/check-updates.sh, and deliberately a separate script:
# check-updates.sh iterates packages/*/env.sh and its contract is "every package", which
# the Debian base is not. What the two share is the JSON shape, so the workflow can
# concatenate them and open one pull request per entry with no idea which script produced
# which.
#
# Two knobs, both about cadence rather than correctness:
#
#   MIN_AGE_DAYS  how old the pin has to be before a bump is proposed (default 30).
#                 Debian publishes a dated sid image every two to three weeks, and every
#                 bump invalidates the builder tag and with it all 36 packages' build
#                 caches on both architectures — a full rebuild. That is a fine thing to
#                 spend monthly and a waste to spend fortnightly, so this is what turns a
#                 weekly cron into a monthly bump without a second schedule.
#
#   STALE_DAYS    how old the pin has to be before this says so loudly (default 90).
#                 The failure mode of automation is silence: a checker that stops finding
#                 updates and a checker that stops running look identical from the outside
#                 until somebody notices the toolchain is a year old.
