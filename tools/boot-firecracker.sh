# Firecracker gets a release binary from github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker; it
# needs /dev/kvm and nothing else, not root.
#
# What it boots is the image every other script boots, unchanged: rootfs.erofs attached
# read-only, and the kernel arguments from rootfs.cmdline that carry its dm-verity root
# hash. The kernel is the one CI built, too. On amd64 Firecracker does not load a bzImage —
# it boots an uncompressed vmlinux through its PVH entry point — so the vmlinux inside the
# bzImage is extracted at every boot (extract_vmlinux, tools/lib.sh); arm64's Image is
# already uncompressed. The devices are virtio over MMIO, which packages/kernel/build.sh's
# guest.config builds in and test/vmm.sh checks on qemu's equivalent machine.
#
# ssh needs no network: the guest has a vsock device, systemd's ssh generator puts sshd on
# vsock port 22 by itself, and Firecracker exposes the guest's vsock ports to the host as
# a Unix socket that takes one "CONNECT <port>" line first. qemu_ssh_setup's SSH_PROXY is
# that handshake, through socat, so ./tools/ssh.sh works exactly as it does for qemu.
#
# The network is opt-in, because Firecracker has no user-mode network: the guest gets a
# tap device on the host, and making one needs root. With TAP set, the guest is given a
# static address — there is no DHCP server on a tap — as a networkd credential matching
# its MAC, which outranks the image's DHCP-on-everything 20-wired.network for that one
# interface. A host side that routes it to the world, once:
#
#     sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap user "$USER"
#     sudo ip addr add 172.16.0.1/24 dev tap0 && sudo ip link set tap0 up
#     sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
#     sudo nft add table ip flfs
#     sudo nft add chain ip flfs post '{ type nat hook postrouting priority 100; }'
#     sudo nft add rule ip flfs post ip saddr 172.16.0.0/24 masquerade
#
# Leave the guest with `reboot` (reboot=k makes that end Firecracker), or kill it.
