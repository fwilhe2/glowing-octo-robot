# Push the OCI images this build produced to a registry, as one multi-arch image:
#
#     ./tools/publish-oci.sh                      # both arches, from artifacts/
#     TAG=v1 ./tools/publish-oci.sh               # under a name of your choosing
#     REGISTRY=localhost:5000 ./tools/publish-oci.sh
#
# It expects the two archives where CI's download-artifact leaves them,
# artifacts/oci-image-<arch>/flfs-oci.tar, which is also where tools/fetch-image.sh
# puts a downloaded one. Both have to be present: the point of this script is the
# manifest list, and a list with one entry is just an image with extra steps.
#
# Unlike the builder and sources images, this one is not content-addressed — it is the
# output of a build rather than an input to it, and what went into it is the whole
# repository. So the tag is the commit, and `latest` follows main.
#
# Nothing here needs skopeo or buildah. `podman load` reads the hand-written layout
# image/build-rootfs.sh produces, and podman is already the only container tool this
# repository uses.
