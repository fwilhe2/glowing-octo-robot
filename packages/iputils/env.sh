# ping, and the two other things worth having next to it. The first command anyone types
# on a machine whose network looks wrong, and until now the image could not answer it.
#
# iputils is the ping every Linux distribution ships — Debian, Fedora, Arch and Alpine's
# non-busybox build all take it from here. It moved to meson and dropped its museum
# (rarpd, rdisc, traceroute6, tftpd) over the last few releases, so what is left is four
# small C programs rather than a 1990s network suite.
#
# Releases are dated rather than numbered, which tools/upstream.sh handles unaided: it
# keeps candidates matching ^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*$, and a bare date satisfies that. The
# tarball is a release asset, not GitHub's generated archive — those are regenerated on
# demand and have changed bytes under a fixed tag before now, which a SHA256 pin turns
# into a build that stops.
