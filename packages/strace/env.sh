# strace: every system call a process makes, with its arguments decoded. The first tool
# to reach for when something fails with an errno and no message — which, on an image
# whose /etc is read-only and whose /var starts empty, is most of what goes wrong. C, no
# dependencies once its optional stack unwinder is configured out (build.sh).
