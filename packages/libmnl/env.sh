# The netfilter project's minimal netlink helper, here because iproute2 wants it.
#
# 1.0.5 is from 2019, which the "is it maintained or just old?" question in CLAUDE.md
# says to be suspicious of. It survives the question: libmnl is a ~30 KB wrapper around
# the netlink socket layout, it does exactly one thing, and it has been finished for
# years — Debian, Fedora and Alpine all ship this same release, and every netfilter tool
# in the archive links it. An old version number here is completion, not neglect.
