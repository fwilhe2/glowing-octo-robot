# nft, the nftables command line, on the libmnl and libnftnl already here for iptables.
# netavark (the podman network backend) has no iptables driver since 2.0: it builds its
# rules as JSON and hands them to `nft -j`, so this is what container networking runs on.
# It is also simply the firewall tool for this kernel, which has no legacy xtables.
