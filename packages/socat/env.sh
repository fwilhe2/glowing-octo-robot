# socat: a bidirectional pipe between any two of TCP, UDP, unix sockets, vsock, ptys and
# files. Here for talking to the sockets things on this image listen on — podman's API,
# CRI-O's, systemd's varlink services — and for the vsock a Firecracker or
# Virtualization.framework host reaches the guest through. curl covers HTTP over a unix
# socket; socat is everything that is not HTTP. C, against the OpenSSL the base ships.
