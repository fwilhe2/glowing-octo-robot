# ps, top, free, pgrep/pkill, sysctl, vmstat, watch, uptime and w: the tools for asking a
# running machine what it is doing. Until this the guest could only answer that from
# /proc by hand, which is what made debugging a misbehaving dockerd in it so slow.
#
# procps-ng is the only candidate that keeps the stack GNU-shaped. It is the maintained
# continuation of procps (the -ng fork is from 2011 and is now simply upstream), shipped
# as the default by Debian, Fedora, Arch and Alpine alike; busybox's applets are out by
# constraint 1. Releases are on SourceForge, where upstream still publishes the dist
# tarball — the GitLab tag archives have no generated configure.
