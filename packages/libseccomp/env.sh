# The seccomp filter library: compiles a syscall policy into the BPF program the kernel
# runs on every syscall. Here so that a container's seccomp profile is enforced rather
# than accepted and ignored — crun and podman both hand theirs to this — and so that
# systemd's SystemCallFilter= and friends work, which -Dseccomp=disabled had switched off
# for every unit that asks.
#
# Maintained (2.6.x, 2026), and the one implementation: every distribution ships it, and
# Docker's and podman's default profiles are written against it.
