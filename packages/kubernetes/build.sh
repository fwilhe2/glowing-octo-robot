# kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl, as upstream builds them (hack/lib/golang.sh): kubeadm and
# kubectl static (CGO_ENABLED=0), kubelet with cgo, against our glibc through the
# builder's CGO_CFLAGS/CGO_LDFLAGS like podman, and the tags upstream builds every
# release binary with — notest, and grpcnotrace, which lets the linker drop gRPC's tracing
# and is worth about a third of kubelet's size. Not selinux: the kernel has no SELinux.
# The rest of the release — the control plane, kube-proxy — runs as pods from
# registry.k8s.io images, which is the version skew kubeadm manages and not something a
# node ships.
#
# The tree is a Go workspace (go.work over staging/) with the workspace vendored, so the
# builder's -mod=vendor works as it is. Upstream's Makefile is not used: it wants git to
# compute the version and rebuilds its own tooling on the way. The version is what it
# would have computed, stamped the way hack/lib/version.sh does it, into both packages
# that report it — kubeadm refuses to work with a kubelet that cannot say what it is.
# gitCommit is left empty, as for podman: a release tarball has no .git.

# kubeadm's own unit and drop-in, folded into one: kubeadm writes the flags file and the
# configuration, then restarts this. Until it has, kubelet exits for want of a config and
# Restart= brings it back, which is upstream's behaviour too.
#
# A node's PKI and identity live under /var, and on a tmpfs /var it would come back from
# every reboot as a stranger to its own cluster. That is refused here rather than
# discovered there: the check exits 78 (EX_CONFIG), which RestartPreventExitStatus turns
# into a failed unit — a `degraded` boot that names the reason — instead of a restart loop.
