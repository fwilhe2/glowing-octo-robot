# The container runtime kubelet talks to: CRI-O, the Kubernetes CRI from the same
# ecosystem as podman, sharing its image and storage libraries, policy.json,
# registries.conf, conmon and crun — all of which the image already ships. Go with cgo
# for libseccomp, plus pinns in C; dependencies vendored in the repository.
# In the kubernetes system extension, not the image (EXTENSION, see build.sh).
#
# CRI-O's minor tracks Kubernetes': 1.37 serves kubelet 1.37, and packages/kubernetes
# has to be bumped with it.
