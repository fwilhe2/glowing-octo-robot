# gdbserver, out of the gdb source tree, and only gdbserver: the half of gdb that runs
# beside the program being debugged. The other half — symbols, source, the user
# interface — runs on the host, which has the debug info and an editor where this
# machine has neither. A VM is the case gdbserver exists for, and it avoids everything
# full gdb would bring: GMP and MPFR at runtime, its embedded Python unless configured
# out, and many times the size. docs/guides/debugging.md has the recipe.
