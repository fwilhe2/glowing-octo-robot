# The trust store: Mozilla's CA list, which is what "curl https://..." verifies against.
# A TLS library with no roots to chain to fails every connection, so this is not optional
# once openssl and curl are here.
#
# This is the third package whose source is data rather than code, after iana-etc and the
# kernel's firmware-free config — and the second whose upstream is a *distribution*
# rather than the project itself. Mozilla publishes the roots as certdata.txt, a PKCS#11
# object dump inside NSS, and turning that into PEM takes a parser. Debian's
# ca-certificates is that parser plus a snapshot of certdata.txt, versioned by the date
# it was taken, and it is what Buildroot, OpenWrt, Void and Gentoo all build their
# bundles from. Taking it from the same place means the roots here are the roots Debian
# ships, decided by the people who already do that work.
#
# The alternative — curl.se's prebuilt cacert.pem — is one file and no parser, but it is
# not an archive, so it would be the only package in the tree that tools/prep.sh could
# not unpack. Not worth a special case for a build step that is one `make`.
#
# The parser is python and uses python3-cryptography; both are builder-side only. See
# CLAUDE.md: what the image may not gain is an interpreter, and what ships from here is
# a text file.
