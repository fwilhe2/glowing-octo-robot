# The HTTP client, and the reason the TLS stack above it is here. `curl https://...` from
# inside the guest is half of what issue #77 asks for; the other half is `ip`.
#
# There is no second candidate worth listing. wget2 and httpie are the alternatives and
# neither is close: wget2 drags in its own TLS choice plus libpsl and gettext, httpie is
# python. curl is C, and it is in every distribution.
