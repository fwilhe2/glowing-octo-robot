# meson rather than the Makefile: the Makefile sets its own CFLAGS with `?=`, which the
# exported sysroot flags would replace wholesale, while meson_install hands the sysroot
# over the way every other meson package here gets it. upstream's own -Os comes after
# the buildtype and wins, which is their choice for a process that runs once per
# container.

# Into /usr/bin, as Fedora ships it, because it is not podman's: conmon is the monitor
# every engine here runs containers under — podman, and CRI-O in the kubernetes
# extension — and both find it on $PATH with no configuration. With crun it is the part
# of the container runtime the base keeps when the engines are extensions. libsystemd is
# for the journald log driver, which is podman's default here. libseccomp is found and
# *not* linked, correctly: seccomp notify (`--seccomp-policy`) is the raw seccomp(2)
# syscall, and <seccomp.h> is only included for its types.
