# The netlink library userspace speaks to the kernel's nf_tables through: it builds and
# parses the rule, set and chain messages, on top of libmnl (already here for iproute2).
# Here for iptables-nft, which is xtables-nft-multi's one hard dependency beyond libmnl;
# nft itself would be the second consumer. Upstream is netfilter.org, the same project as
# the kernel side, and every distribution ships it.
