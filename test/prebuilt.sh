# Every other check here runs something compiled in builder/, against our sysroot. That
# leaves out the most common way anything gets onto a general-purpose Linux — somebody
# else's toolchain, on somebody else's distribution — and it is a different question,
# because a prebuilt binary asks for whatever *its* toolchain links by default rather
# than whatever our configure lines allowed. Until packages/gcc existed, the answer for
# nearly every Rust binary for a *-linux-gnu target was "libgcc_s.so.1: cannot open
# shared object file", and nothing here said so.
#
# So this compiles a handful of small programs on the host, with the host's stock
# compilers, and runs them in the image. Each is chosen for what it needs from the image,
# not for what it does:
#
#   c-cancel     pthread_cancel, which makes glibc dlopen libgcc_s — the case
#                check-rootfs-deps.sh cannot see, since nothing has it in NEEDED.
#   cxx          libstdc++ and an exception that has to unwind through it.
#   rust         libgcc_s in NEEDED, and a panic caught with catch_unwind.
#   go-cgo       a dynamically linked Go binary, through glibc's NSS for user lookup,
#                and /usr/share/zoneinfo through time.LoadLocation.
#   go-static    the CGO_ENABLED=0 binary most Go projects publish: zoneinfo, and the
#                CA bundle where crypto/x509 looks for it.
#
# Compiling and running are separate so that CI can compile once, in the rootfs job, and
# run the same bytes in both flavours: in the OCI image there, and over ssh in the boot
# job's guest (test/ssh.sh does that when PREBUILT names a directory). The two are not
# redundant. The container is the disk image *minus* the subtractions block, so it is
# the stricter test of whether a library is present — only it would notice a subtraction
# taking libgcc_s. The guest is the image as a VM user gets it, and differs where these
# programs look: its nsswitch.conf puts systemd's NSS modules ahead of files, so
# go-cgo's user lookup takes another path there.
#
# A host compiler that is missing skips its program with a note locally and fails under
# CI, where all four are expected. The host's toolchain also has to be no newer than
# ours: a binary built against a newer glibc, or by a g++ whose libstdc++ defines
# GLIBCXX versions packages/gcc's does not, is correctly refused. That is a coupling worth
# hearing about — it is how this test says packages/gcc wants a bump — but it is a
# statement about the host as much as the image.
