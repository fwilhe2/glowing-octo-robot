#     ./test/podman.sh [rootfs.erofs] [bzImage]
#
# Overrides: TIMEOUT, MEM/CPUS, LOG, LOGIN_USER, as in test/container.sh.
#
# Four rounds, so a failure says which layer broke:
#   1. podman's own report: crun as the runtime, netavark as the network backend,
#      seccomp available, overlay storage. Each of those is a build decision somewhere in
#      packages/ that can quietly come out differently.
#   2. a container runs, in its own pid namespace, with a seccomp filter applied — read
#      from /proc/self/status inside it, which is the kernel's answer rather than
#      podman's claim. `Seccomp: 2` is filter mode.
#   3. the network from inside a container: a name resolves and a TCP connection to it
#      opens, which is netavark's bridge, veth and nftables rules, and podman's resolv.conf.
#      And a published port: nothing in the test image can listen, so this only proves
#      the DNAT and conntrack-mark rules `-p` adds are ones the kernel accepts — which is
#      the half that broke, twice, while this was written (NFT_FIB_INET and
#      NF_CONNTRACK_MARK in packages/kernel/build.sh).
#   4. Quadlet: a .container file becomes a unit at daemon-reload and the container comes
#      up under systemd. /run/containers/systemd, because /etc is read-only.
#
# The image is made in the guest, not pulled: a few files out of the guest's own /usr
# imported as a one-layer image. Pulling would make the test depend on a registry's
# availability and rate limits, which Docker Hub's anonymous ones turn into a coin toss
# from a shared CI runner. bash, getent and sleep — the last to keep the Quadlet
# container up long enough to be seen running — are all the rounds need, and all three
# are on the guest's own disk. Their libraries are named rather than found, because the
# list is three files long.
