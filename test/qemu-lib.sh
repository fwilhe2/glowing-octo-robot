#   qemu_preflight   refuse now if the binary or the images are missing
#   qemu_ssh_setup   optional: an ephemeral key, a port forward to the guest's sshd and
#                    the credential that authorizes the one over the other (see below)
#   qemu_argv        build the common command line into $QEMU_ARGV
#   qemu_boot        run it in the background on a fifo, logging to $LOG
#
# ...and then drives the console with console_send / console_mark / await /
# console_login. tools/boot-qemu.sh stops after qemu_argv and execs it instead, handing
# the console to the terminal.

#            console. On amd64 that is qemu's microvm machine with ACPI off, booting an
#            uncompressed vmlinux through PVH — which is how Firecracker boots one.
