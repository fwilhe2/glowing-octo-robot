#                                there is no KVM, and that is slow)
#   MEM/CPUS   guest size        (default 1024 / 2)

# `systemctl is-system-running` is the main assertion: it reports `degraded` if and
# only if at least one unit failed, so it covers units nothing else here thinks to look
# at. --wait blocks until startup has actually settled, which is what keeps this from
# racing a unit that is merely slow; the deadline below is what catches one that hangs.
# Two more ride along on the same shell, because a login over a serial console is the
# expensive part and running one more command on it is free: systemd's Tainted property,
# and flfsfetch, which is the only binary in usr/bin that anything in test/ ever runs
# for its own sake.
#
# This is deliberately separate from test/boot.sh and test/network.sh rather than folded
# into either: test/boot.sh proves the kernel and the loader work with a raw shell as
# PID 1, test/network.sh proves addressing and DNS, and this proves systemd itself is
# happy. Three failures that mean three different things stay three different tests —
# what they share is the plumbing, which is test/qemu-lib.sh.
