#     ./test/verity.sh [rootfs.erofs] [bzImage]
#
# The byte is the first one in the file, in the 1 KiB EROFS reserves ahead of its
# superblock for a boot sector it never has. EROFS does not read it as data, so without
# verity the tampered image boots exactly like the original — and that is what makes the
# choice sharp rather than lazy: the only thing that can notice is a hash over the whole
# 4 KiB block it sits in. Changing a byte inside a file would also fail, but would leave
# open whether the filesystem or verity caught it.
#
# Two things have to be true: the console carries device-mapper's corruption report, and
# the guest never gets as far as a shell. test/boot.sh boots the same image untampered
# with the same INIT, which is the control: if that passes and this fails the other way,
# the difference is the byte.
