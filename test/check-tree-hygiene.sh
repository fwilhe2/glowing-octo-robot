# Fail an assembled image tree that has a path anyone may write, or a symlink to nothing:
#
#     ./test/check-tree-hygiene.sh <tree>
#
# image/build-rootfs.sh runs it on each flavour's tree once nothing else will change it
# (it is copied into the assembly image beside it); test/selftest.sh runs it on fixtures.
# From Flatcar's cl.filesystem test, which sweeps a booted root the same way.
#
# World-writable: a file or a directory without the sticky bit, which every user may
# change. The disk image is read-only, but the OCI flavour is not, and there it is
# writable by every user in the container.
#
# Dangling: a symlink whose target is not in the tree. Resolved against the tree, a hop
# at a time, because readlink -f and find -xtype follow an absolute link into the root
# this runs in. A target under a filesystem that is mounted at boot or by the runtime —
# dev, proc, sys, run, tmp, var, all shipped empty — cannot be judged here and is not:
# /etc/resolv.conf into /run, a masked unit to /dev/null, /home into var/.
