# Overrides:
#   TIMEOUT    seconds to wait   (default 300 — qemu falls back to TCG in CI, where
#                                 there is no KVM, and that is slow)
#   MEM/CPUS   guest size        (default 1024 / 2)
#   LOG        console transcript (default container-test.log)
#   LOGIN_USER/LOGIN_PASSWORD    serial console credentials (default root / root)
#
# Like test/network.sh this boots systemd rather than a raw shell: crun asks systemd
# over sd-bus to create the cgroup v2 scope, so PID 1 is part of what is under test.
#
# The checks are layered so a failure says where it broke:
#   1. cgroup v2 is mounted and the controllers the kernel fragment adds are delegated
#   2. crun runs and reports the features it was built with
#   3. a container actually starts, and from inside it the pid, uts and mount
#      namespaces are demonstrably not the host's
#
# The bundle is built by hand. `crun spec` writes a complete, valid config.json, and
# the only edits needed are patched in with bash parameter expansion. The image has no
# jq, and none of it is needed for this — grep and sed are there now, but a JSON edit
# is not a job for either.

#   - it ends up as a JSON string in config.json, so it must contain no double quotes

#     so it must contain no single quotes either;
#   - it is the *replacement* half of a bash ${var/pat/repl}, where an unescaped & is a
#     backreference to the whole match — `&&` would silently expand to `"sh""sh"`. Hence
