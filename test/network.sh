# Overrides:
#   HOST/PORT  what to resolve and connect to  (default example.com / 80)
#   TIMEOUT    seconds to wait                 (default 300 — qemu falls back to TCG in
#                                              CI, where there is no KVM, and that is slow)
#   MEM/CPUS   guest size                      (default 1024 / 2)
#   LOG        console transcript              (default network-test.log)
#   LOGIN_USER/LOGIN_PASSWORD  serial console credentials (default root / root)
#
# Unlike test/boot.sh this has to run systemd: the addressing is systemd-networkd's job
# and the resolver is systemd-resolved's, so a raw shell as PID 1 would prove nothing.
# That means logging in at the serial getty first, with the credentials the image ships
# in image/files/etc/shadow — test/qemu-lib.sh's console_login does that part.
#
# The checks come in two rounds, layered so that a failure says where it broke.
#
# The first round asks whether the *system* has a network, using nothing the image had to
# grow a package for: a routable link means DHCP answered, `getent hosts` means the
# systemd-resolved stub that /etc/resolv.conf points at answers, and opening a TCP
# connection means routing and the VMM's NAT work.
#
# The second asks whether anyone logged in could *see and use* it, which is what issue
# #77 was about: `ip` reads the address and route back out of the kernel rather than out
# of networkd's opinion of them, `ping` proves an ICMP socket opens, and `curl` proves
# TLS — name resolution, a chain verified against the shipped CA bundle, and a request.
# Splitting them means "the network is broken" and "the tools are broken" cannot be
# mistaken for one another.
#
# Everything past the first check needs the machine running this to have internet access
# — with qemu's user-mode networking the guest reaches the outside through it.

# Same trick as the READY marker in test/qemu-lib.sh: the guest echoes back everything

# The first round uses nothing but bash builtins, networkctl and getent. That started as
# a constraint — the image had no grep, sed or awk — and is now a choice: bash's [[ ]]
# and /dev/tcp cover what they would have been for, and a console handshake this
# delicate is better off not depending on a package it is not testing. The second round
# is the one place that rule is deliberately broken, because the tools *are* what it is
# testing; it still parses their output with [[ ]] rather than reaching for grep.

# networking only forwards ICMP when the *host* kernel lets an unprivileged process open
# a datagram ICMP socket, which is a property of the machine running the test and not of
# the image. 127.0.0.1 asks the question this test can answer — that the binary runs and
# gets its socket — and leaves reachability to the TCP and TLS checks either side of it.
#
# curl carries the whole TLS stack on its back: resolving the name, verifying the chain
# against /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt, and speaking HTTP over it. -f so an HTTP
# error status is a failure rather than a zero-length body, -sS so only errors print.
