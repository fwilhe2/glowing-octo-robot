#     ./test/rootless.sh [rootfs.erofs] [bzImage]
#
# Overrides: TIMEOUT, MEM/CPUS, LOG, as in test/podman.sh. LOGIN_USER is fixed to the
# uid-1000 account image/files/etc/passwd ships, because that is the point.
#
# Rootless needs three things the rootful path does not, and each round checks one:
#   1. newuidmap and newgidmap with their file capabilities on the disk image — getcap
#      reads them off the mounted root, which proves they survived the tar mkfs.erofs is
#      built from (image/build-rootfs.sh) — and podman reporting itself rootless.
#   2. the ID maps: a container's /proc/self/uid_map has two lines, the user's own uid
#      and the 65536 from /etc/subuid. Only newuidmap can write the second, so one line
#      means the helper did not run or was not allowed to.
#   3. the network, through pasta rather than netavark's bridge: a name resolves and a TCP
#      connection opens from inside the container, and a published port's forwarding is
#      set up (rootlessport).
#
# The same imported test image as test/podman.sh, made by the user into the user's own
# storage under ~/.local/share/containers.
