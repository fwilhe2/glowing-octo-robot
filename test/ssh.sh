# Overrides:
#   TIMEOUT    seconds to wait                 (default 300 — qemu falls back to TCG in
#                                              CI, where there is no KVM, and that is slow)
#   MEM/CPUS   guest size                      (default 1024 / 2)
#   LOG        console transcript              (default ssh-test.log)
#   LOGIN_USER/LOGIN_PASSWORD  serial console credentials (default root / root)
#   SSH_PORT   host port forwarded to the guest's 22 (default the first free from 2222)
#
# Three rounds, layered so a failure says where it broke, the same way test/network.sh is.
#
# The first asks whether the *daemon* is there — the unit is active, sshd-keygen.service
# left a host key behind, and something is accepting connections on port 22. It uses
# nothing but systemctl and bash builtins, so a failure means what it says.
#
# The second asks whether anyone could actually log in, and **the guest connects to
# itself**: a key is generated in the guest, authorized, and used over 127.0.0.1. That
# goes through everything that could be wrong about sshd in this image — the unit, the
# host key, the privilege separation account, the seccomp sandbox, /etc/pam.d/sshd and
# pam_systemd — with no forward and no host in the way, which is why it also checks
# $XDG_SESSION_ID, the one cheap piece of evidence that the session was registered with
# logind rather than merely authenticated.
#
# The third is the way somebody actually uses it: from the host, through tools/ssh.sh,
# with the ephemeral key qemu_ssh_setup generated and the guest was handed as a systemd
# credential at boot. That is the qemu port forward, the kernel-command-line credential
# and the Match block in sshd_config — none of which the second round touches. It runs
# *after* the second on purpose: that round overwrote /root/.ssh/authorized_keys with the
# guest's own key, so whatever systemd's provision.conf copied there at boot is gone, and
# a login now can only have been authorized by the credential where PID 1 put it, in
# /run/credentials/@system. Which is the path every later boot of the same disk depends
# on. It needs an ssh client on the host, which every CI runner image has.

# Round two. Idempotent, because the loop below retries it: ssh-keygen refuses to
# overwrite an existing key, so generate one only if there is none.
#
# root by key is exactly what the shipped sshd_config allows and image/files/etc/shadow's
# throwaway password is not — `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password` — so this doubles as the
# check that that line means what it says.
#
# BatchMode=yes so a failed key is an error rather than a password prompt this console
# would sit at until the deadline. StrictHostKeyChecking=no and a /dev/null known-hosts
# file because the host key was generated on this boot and nothing has seen it before.
#
# XDG_SESSION_ID is set by pam_systemd.so out of /etc/pam.d/sshd, and by nothing else in
# a non-interactive ssh command. An empty one means the session never reached logind,
# which is a broken PAM stack wearing a working login as a disguise.
#
# Tested for being non-empty rather than for looking like a session id, and that is not
# laziness: the ids here are `c1`, `c2`, `c3` and not `1`, `2`, `3`. logind derives a
# numeric id from the kernel's audit session id when there is one, and
# packages/kernel/build.sh turns CONFIG_AUDIT off (there is no audit userspace here), so
# it falls back to generating its own with a `c` prefix. Asserting a shape would be
# asserting the kernel config from the wrong end of the machine.
